# One-shot, quiet post-merge worktree cleanup. Replaces the five-command
# cleanup chain (worktree remove + branch -D + fetch + sync:primary + prune)
# with a single call that emits one status line on success.
#
# Run from OUTSIDE the worktree being removed (the primary checkout or any
# sibling worktree). `sync:primary` is always applied to the resolved primary
# checkout, so this works regardless of where it is invoked.
#
# Safety:
#   - Refuses to remove the primary checkout.
#   - `git branch -D` is a FORCE delete and, because the repo squash-merges,
#     a merged branch's commits are never ancestors of origin/main. To avoid
#     destroying committed-but-unmerged work, when `gh` is available this
#     refuses unless a MERGED PR exists for the branch. Bypass with --force.
#   - The deleted branch's tip SHA is printed for one-command recovery
#     (`git branch <name> <sha>`).
#
# Usage:
#   npm run cleanup:worktree -- <worktree-path> [branch] [--force]
#   bash scripts/worktree-cleanup.sh ../pi-mmr-<slug> [chore/<branch>] [--force]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   cleaned up
#   11  branch has no merged PR — or the gh query failed — and --force not
#       given; refused (no changes made). The guard fails CLOSED: an
#       unanswerable "is it merged?" is treated as "not merged".
#   12  target is the primary checkout; refused
#   13  primary main could not be synced (reconcile manually)
#   64  usage error
#   20  git failure
